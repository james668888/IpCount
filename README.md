# IpCount

This is my first time to develop a nodejs service, and I learned a lot with multiple package, including mocha, express, and mongoose. This service is not 100 percent correct and well-organized, but I tried my best to do it.

How to create this service.
1. install npm, mongodb
2. git clone this project
3. npm install
4. start mongodb service => You can follow this. https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/
5. npm start
6. npm test => for testing
